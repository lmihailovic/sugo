# Sugo
A minimal and dead-simple static site generator.

## Overview
Sugo is a static site generator written in Go, designed to be simple and offer
a _plug-and-play_ experience. 

It was initially thought to be a personal tool, but later
it was decided to make it a personal thesis project and be
made open-source and available to the public.
